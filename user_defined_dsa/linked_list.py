# linked list is chain of node in which each node contains data and a pointer to the next node
# Nodes are connected using pointers
# head /front is the first node of the linked list
# tail/end is the last node of the linked list which points to null

# its a dynamic data structure
# it is not stored in contiguous memory location. It is stored in random memory locations

# Advantages of linked list 
# 1. Dynamic data structure
# 2. Memory utilization is efficient
# 3. Insertion and deletion of elements are easy
# 4. Size of the linked list can be changed dynamically
# 5. Implementation is easy
# 6. No need to specify the size of the linked list
# 7.can be used to implement stack queue and graph
# 8.Respresent and manipulate polynomials.  Polynomial can be represented as a linked list where each node contains the coefficient and the power of the variable in the polynomial term.

# Disadvantages of linked list
# 1. Random access is not allowed. We have to access the elements sequentially starting from the head node.
# 2. Extra memory is required for the pointer to the next node.
# 3. Reverse traversing is difficult in a singly linked list.
# 4. Memory utilization is inefficient as pointers require extra memory.


# Types of linked list
# 1. Singly linked list
# 2. Doubly linked list
# 3. Circular linked list
